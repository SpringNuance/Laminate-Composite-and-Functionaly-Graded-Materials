# Laminated-Composite-and-Functionally-Graded-Materials

Task 1: Create a Matlab/python script that computes the Classical Lamination Theory (CLT) and First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) stiffness matrices for given stacking sequence.

Task 2: Do option a or b:

Option a) Compute the Navier solution for the laminated rectangular plate when being simply supported from all four edges and under uniform pressure load.

Option b) Show with commercial FE-solver the role of shape functions and CLT vs FSDT to the computed results on simply supported square plate with uniform pressure load acting normal to plate surface.

Task 3: Create a Matlab/Python script to compute ABD-matrix for functionally-graded plates with given decay of material properties through the thickness.

Task 4: Explain with equations the difference between degenerated continuum shell elements and equivalent single layer shell elements. Explain also the benefits and weaknesses of both modelling strategies.
